The `quotes` array contains famous quotes from various individuals such as Steve Jobs, Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, and even includes a custom quote by Rick Astley. The `getRandomQuote()` function randomly selects one of these quotes and returns it.

   ```

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser or execute the script in your preferred JavaScript environment.
   
3. Enjoy receiving random inspirational quotes!

## Usage

You can utilize this code snippet to display a random quote on your website or incorporate it into any JavaScript application where generating random quotes might be useful.

Here's an example usage:

```javascript
const quotes = [
  "The only way to do great work is to love what you do. - Steve Jobs",
  "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. - Steve Jobs",
  "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts. - Winston Churchill",
  "Believe you can and you're halfway there. - Theodore Roosevelt",
  "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. - Eleanor Roosevelt",
  "\"Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you!\" - Rick Astley",
];

function getRandomQuote() {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);
    return quotes[randomIndex];
}

console.log(getRandomQuote());
```

Feel free to modify the `quotes` array by adding or removing quotes of your choice.

You can also customize the implementation and usage based on your specific requirements.
